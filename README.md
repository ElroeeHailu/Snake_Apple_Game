A simple Snake Apple Game project to test my understanding of python.

The rules are simple:
* Red blocks are apples - snake grows longer by one block for every apple eaten
* Black blocks are walls - game is over is snake hits a wall
* Yellow blocks are growth power ups - pop up every 5 apples eaten and increases the lenght on the snake by 3 blocks
